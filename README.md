This is a pretty awesome app. Coming back to this code base months later I can see how much I've grown. 

Here are some take aways:

Always use stored procedures


Modularize code


Write better comments


Avoid global anything if possible


Come up with more consistent variable names


Trust the process


Use classes to organize code


Import and export(for js) are your friend
